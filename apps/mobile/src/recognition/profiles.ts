/**
 * Sign-language vocabulary profiles.
 *
 * ## The rule this file exists to enforce
 *
 * Sign languages are not dialects of one another. ISL, ASL and BSL have
 * distinct grammars and, in places, mutually incompatible gestures — a hand
 * shape that means one thing in ISL may be meaningless or offensive in ASL.
 * There is therefore **no shared gesture dictionary**, and there must never be
 * one. Vocabulary is owned per profile.
 *
 * ## Status: no vocabulary exists
 *
 * All profiles below are `planned` with `vocabularySize: 0`. No signs have been
 * defined, because defining them is a Deaf-led linguistic task, not a coding
 * task, and no dataset or model exists. Any sign list appearing in this
 * repository before that work is done should be treated as fiction.
